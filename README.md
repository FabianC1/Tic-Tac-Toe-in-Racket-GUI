# Tic-Tac-Toe in Racket GUI

This project is a graphical implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Racket programming language with its built-in `racket/gui` library.

## Features

- Fully interactive 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board
- Graphical user interface built with Racket's `gui` module
- Basic AI logic for detecting wins, ties, and tracking player turns
- Scorekeeping (optional based on version)
- "New Game" and "Replay" functionality

## Requirements

- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) (Ensure it's installed and added to PATH)

## Running the Game

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Racket-GUI.git
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Racket-GUI
   ```
2. Open the .rkt file in DrRacket or run via terminal:
   ```
   racket "racket tic-tac-toe.rkt"
   ```


## Final Notes
This project serves as a practical introduction to building GUIs in Racket and implementing basic game logic.
